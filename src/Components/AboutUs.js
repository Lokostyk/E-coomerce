                            High-quality fabrics feature fibers that are closely and tightly woven together. There should be no obvious gaps between fibers as thatâ€™s often an indication of weakness in the fiber quality. These fabrics can tear easily. High quality fabrics have a more well-balanced combination of vertical and horizontal weaves, which make for a stronger fabric surface.
